## Introduction

`k8s-sysdig-adapter` is an implementation of the
[Custom Metrics API][custom-metrics-api-types] using
[Sysdig Monitor][sysdig-monitor].

If you have a Kubernetes cluster and you are a Sysdig user, this adapter
enables you to create [horizontal pod autoscalers][l4] based on metrics provided
by Sysdig's monitoring solution.

In the following example, we're creating an autoscaler based on the
`net.http.request.count` metric. The autoscaler will adjust the number of pods
deployed for our service as the metric fluctuates over or below the threshold
(`targetValue`).

```yaml
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
metadata:
  name: kuard
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: kuard
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Object
    object:
      target:
        kind: Service
        name: kuard
      metricName: net.http.request.count
      targetValue: 100
```

## Prerequisites

You're going to need:

- **Kubernetes 1.8+**
- **Sysdig Monitor** - see the [installation instructions][sysdig-monitor-docs-installation].
- **Sysdig Monitor Access Key** - which you've used during the installation of Sysdig Monitor.
- **Sysdig Monitor API Token** - see where to find it in [these instructions][sysdig-monitor-docs-api]. Do not confuse the **API token** with the **agent access key**, they're not the same! This is the API token that our metrics server is going to use when accessing the API.

## Installation

The configuration files that you can find under the [deploy](./deploy) directory
are just for reference. Every deployment is unique so tweak them as needed. At
the very least, you need to use your own **access key** and **API token** as
follows:

- [01-sysdig-daemon-set.yml](./deploy/01-sysdig-daemon-set.yml) installs the
  Sysdig agent - edit it so it uses your own access key.
- [03-sysdig-metrics-server.yml](./deploy/03-sysdig-metrics-server.yml) installs
  a `secret` in Kubernetes containing the Sysdig Monitor API token - edit it to
  use your own token.

Now we're ready to start! :tada:

1. For the purpose of this example we're going to deploy [kuard][kuard], a demo
   application found in the "Kubernetes Up and Running" book. This application
   is deployed with three replicas by default.

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/00-kuard.yml
   ```

   Let's check that it's running:

   ```
    $ kubectl get pods -l app=kuard -o wide
    NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP          NODE
    kuard-bcc7bf7df-clv2f   1/1       Running   0          1m        10.46.0.2   worker-node-2
    kuard-bcc7bf7df-d9svn   1/1       Running   0          1m        10.40.0.2   worker-node-1
    kuard-bcc7bf7df-zg8nc   1/1       Running   0          1m        10.46.0.3   worker-node-2
    ```

2. Install Sysdig Monitor if you haven't done it yet - they have
   [great docs][sysdig-monitor-docs-installation] that you can use. In this
   example, we're going to install it using a `DaemonSet` object as follows:

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/01-sysdig-daemon-set.yml
   ```

   **Don't forget to add your own access key to the file!**

3. The following command is going to deploy a number of required objects like
   a custom namespace `custom-metrics`, required RBAC roles, permissions,
   bindings and the service object for our metrics server:

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/02-sysdig-metrics-rbac.yml
   ```

4. Deploy the metrics server with:

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/03-sysdig-metrics-server.yml
   ```

   **Don't forget to add your own API token to the file!**

   It should be possible to retrieve the full list of metrics available using
   the following command:

   ```
   $ kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq -r ".resources[].name"
   ```

5. Deploy our custom autoscaler that scales our service based on the
   `net.http.request.count` metric.

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/04-kuard-hpa.yml
   ```

At this point you should be able to see the autoscaler in action. In the
example, we set a threshold of 100 requests per minute. Let's generate some
traffic with [hey][hey]:

    $ hey -c 5 -q 85 -z 24h http://10.103.86.213

Finally, use the following command to watch the autoscaler:

    $ kubectl get hpa kuard-autoscaler -w
    NAME               REFERENCE          TARGETS       MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
    kuard-autoscaler   Deployment/kuard   105763m/100   3         10        8          2d

## Playground

You can find a playground based on Vagrant virtual machines under the
[playground](./playground) directory in this repository. You can use it to demo
this project or for development purposes.

[minikube][minikube] has not been tried yet! See
[issue #3](https://github.com/draios/kubernetes-sysdig-metrics-apiserver/issues/3) for more
details.
